Some countries exclude certain categories of workers, such as agricultural workers or domestic workers, as well as enterprises of a certain size, from the general regime of their employment protection regulations. Note, however, that if certain workers are excluded from the general regime, this may mean either that they are not covered at all, or that they are covered by other, specific regulations. For example, civil servants are often covered by a specific regime. In contrast, domestic workers are often excluded from any protection altogether.  Some countries have undertaken reforms to expand legal coverage by extending employment protection laws to more workers or enterprises.",

The informal sector in an economy may be a source of unfair competition to formal firms and also deprive governments of potential tax revenue and diminish a government's capacity for regulatory oversight. Informality can be defined along different dimensions such as operating without registration, income tax evasion, labor tax evasion, or operating outside the legal framework of an economy. Firms may show different degrees of informality along these dimensions which may also overlap. A large informal sector has serious consequences for the formal private sector, and may pose unfair competition for formal firms. It is an approximation to the prevalence of informality in the private economy.",

It includes communication with the general public, families and communities about public health risks, for which events and outbreak communication is an essential part. Risk communications should take into consideration the social, religious, cultural, political and economic context in which events occur, and also involve listening to the affected populations. Information dissemination through appropriate channels is also important.
